# PyNAnts

### An Ant Simulation written in Python

This is an ant pheromone trail simulation, written in Python3,
with Pygame2 and Numpy.


**To use** save the `nants.py` file somewhere, and run via python.
(Example run command: `python3 nants.py`)

Left mouse click places food, right click removes food.

`Esc` key to quit.

I've included several tweakable settings near the top of the code. You can
adjust window size, fullscreen, fps, and how many ants to spawn.
The pixel resolution ratio of the pheromone trail surface is also tweakable,
although it alters how their pathfinding logic may work.

ToDo list of things that need improving/implementing:
- Obstacle/wall avoidance, especially when heading home to nest.
- Food particles don't pickup/remove yet when ants 'grab' them.

If you have any suggestions for how to improve these, please contact me!
